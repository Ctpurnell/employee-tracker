# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker

## Task

For this assignment we were tasked with creating an employee tracker that is used in the command line. In this CLI application we needed to be able to access a database to show tables for an Employee Tracker. Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. Our assignment this week is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## Mock-Up
